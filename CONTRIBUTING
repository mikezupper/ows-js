### Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, We also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.
